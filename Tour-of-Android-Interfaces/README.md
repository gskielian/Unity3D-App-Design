Android App Design Using Unity3D
=======

Games and Apps may both be quickly designed using the Unity3D Platform.

I feel that this shifts focus back to IMHO what is most important for your game or app: your product's design, pitch, and features. 


### Design Your World(s)


choose one or more of the following:
1. create an Android App (apk)
2. Burn a disc for distribution and publicize your app.
3. Create a website

### Create Your Character

### Level Portal
First we will make a level portal --  allowing you to warp between worlds you made.
